  1. Azure Container Apps (ACA)

  This is often the recommended and best-fit option for most new containerized functions.

   * What it is: A serverless container service specifically designed for running microservices. It's built on
     Kubernetes but hides all the complexity. It has first-class support for KEDA (Kubernetes Event-driven
     Autoscaling), which allows your function to scale from zero to many instances based on triggers like queue
     messages, event hub events, or HTTP trafficâ€”just like a regular function.
   * When to use it:
       * For event-driven microservices where you want powerful, trigger-based autoscaling without managing a
         Kubernetes cluster.
       * When you want a simple, serverless experience for your containers.
       * It's the modern "sweet spot" between the simplicity of PaaS and the power of Kubernetes.

  2. Azure Functions Premium Plan

   * What it is: A hosting plan dedicated to Azure Functions that fully supports running custom container
     images. It's a "Functions-native" experience.
   * When to use it:
       * When you want the benefits of a custom container but prefer to stay within the familiar Azure Functions
         management and deployment ecosystem.
       * When you need features of the Premium plan, such as VNet integration, no "cold starts" (with pre-warmed
         instances), and longer execution timeouts. The platform manages the scaling for you based on your
         function triggers.

  3. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

   * What it is: Azure's full-featured, managed Kubernetes service. It gives you maximum power, control, and
     flexibility over your container orchestration.
   * When to use it:
       * When your organization already uses AKS for other microservices and you want to consolidate all your
         workloads on a single platform.
       * When you need advanced Kubernetes features like a service mesh (e.g., Istio, Linkerd), custom
         networking policies, or very specific node configurations.
       * Note: This option comes with the highest operational complexity. You are responsible for managing the
         cluster, networking, ingress controllers, and the KEDA installation to enable event-driven scaling for
         your function.

  4. Azure App Service (Web App for Containers)

   * What it is: Azure's flagship PaaS for hosting web applications can also run container images. You deploy
     your container to an App Service Plan.
   * When to use it:
       * If you are already heavily invested in the App Service platform and are comfortable with its scaling
         model (based on the CPU/memory of the plan, not function triggers).
       * For simple scenarios or when you want to run your function alongside a traditional web application in
         the same App Service Plan.
